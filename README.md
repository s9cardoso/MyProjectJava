My First Java Project - RESTful Web API with Spring and Spring Data JPA

This project demonstrates how to build a simple RESTful web API using **Spring Boot** and **Spring Data JPA** for data persistence. 
The goal of this project was to create a functional backend application with the ability to perform CRUD operations on entities stored in an H2 embedded database.
